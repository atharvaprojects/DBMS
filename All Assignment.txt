Sure! Let's go over the fundamental concepts of SQL and PL/SQL. This comprehensive overview will cover a range of topics from basic SQL operations to advanced PL/SQL concepts.

### **SQL Concepts**

#### **1. Basics of SQL**
- **SQL (Structured Query Language):** A standard language for managing and manipulating databases.
- **Types of SQL Commands:**
  - **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Commands that define the structure of the database.
  - **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Commands that manipulate the data within the database.
  - **DCL (Data Control Language):** Commands that control access to the data within the database.
  - **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Commands that manage transactions within the database.

#### **2. DDL Commands**
- **CREATE:** Used to create a new table, database, index, or view.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE employees (
      employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(50),
      department VARCHAR(50)
  );
  ```
- **ALTER:** Used to modify an existing database object.
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE employees ADD salary DECIMAL(10, 2);
  ```
- **DROP:** Used to delete an existing database object.
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE employees;
  ```
- **TRUNCATE:** Used to remove all records from a table without logging individual row deletions.
  ```sql
  TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
  ```

#### **3. DML Commands**
- **INSERT:** Adds new records to a table.
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, department) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'HR');
  ```
- **UPDATE:** Modifies existing records in a table.
  ```sql
  UPDATE employees SET salary = 50000 WHERE employee_id = 1;
  ```
- **DELETE:** Removes existing records from a table.
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 1;
  ```

#### **4. DCL Commands**
- **GRANT:** Gives a user access privileges to the database.
  ```sql
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO user1;
  ```
- **REVOKE:** Removes access privileges from a user.
  ```sql
  REVOKE INSERT ON employees FROM user1;
  ```

#### **5. Constraints**
- **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
  ```sql
  PRIMARY KEY (employee_id)
  ```
- **Foreign Key:** Ensures referential integrity by linking two tables.
  ```sql
  FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
  ```
- **Unique:** Ensures all values in a column are unique.
  ```sql
  UNIQUE (email)
  ```
- **Not Null:** Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.
  ```sql
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
  ```
- **Check:** Ensures values in a column meet a specific condition.
  ```sql
  CHECK (salary > 0)
  ```
- **IN Operator:** Used to filter records based on a list of values.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN ('HR', 'Finance');
  ```

#### **6. Aggregate Functions**
- **COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN:**
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(salary), AVG(salary), MAX(salary), MIN(salary) FROM employees;
  ```

#### **7. Built-in Functions**
- **Numeric Functions:** e.g., `ABS()`, `POWER()`
  ```sql
  SELECT ABS(-10), POWER(2, 3);
  ```
- **Date Functions:** e.g., `NOW()`, `DATEADD()`
  ```sql
  SELECT NOW(), DATEADD(year, 1, '2023-01-01');
  ```
- **String Functions:** e.g., `CONCAT()`, `SUBSTRING()`
  ```sql
  SELECT CONCAT('Hello', 'World'), SUBSTRING('HelloWorld', 1, 5);
  ```

#### **8. Set Operations**
- **UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT:**
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM employees UNION SELECT name FROM managers;
  ```

#### **9. Sub-queries and Correlated Sub-queries**
- **Sub-query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
  ```
- **Correlated Sub-query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT e1.name FROM employees e1 WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees e2 WHERE e1.department_id = e2.department_id);
  ```

#### **10. Joins**
- **INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN:**
  ```sql
  SELECT employees.name, departments.name FROM employees INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
  ```

#### **11. EXISTS, ANY, ALL**
- **EXISTS:**
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM employees WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM departments WHERE employees.department_id = departments.department_id);
  ```
- **ANY:**
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > ANY (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR');
  ```
- **ALL:**
  ```sql
  SELECT name FROM employees WHERE salary > ALL (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR');
  ```

#### **12. Views**
- **View and its types:**
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 100000;
  ```

#### **13. Transaction Control Commands**
- **COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT:**
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, name, department) VALUES (2, 'Jane Doe', 'Finance');
  SAVEPOINT savepoint1;
  UPDATE employees SET salary = 60000 WHERE employee_id = 2;
  ROLLBACK TO savepoint1;
  COMMIT;
  ```

### **PL/SQL Concepts**

#### **1. Cursors**
- **Implicit Cursor: Automatically created by Oracle for single SQL statements.**
- **Explicit Cursor: Defined by the programmer for queries returning multiple rows.**
  ```sql
  DECLARE
    CURSOR emp_cursor IS SELECT employee_id, name FROM employees;
  BEGIN
    FOR emp_record IN emp_cursor LOOP
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(emp_record.name);
    END LOOP;
  END;
  ```

#### **2. Stored Procedures**
- **A stored procedure is a precompiled set of one or more SQL statements that perform some specific task.**
  ```sql
  CREATE PROCEDURE raise_salary (emp_id INT, increment DECIMAL) AS
  BEGIN
    UPDATE employees SET salary = salary + increment WHERE employee_id = emp_id;
  END;
  ```

#### **3. Stored Function**
- **A stored function is similar to a procedure but returns a single value.**
  ```sql
  CREATE FUNCTION get_salary (emp_id INT) RETURN DECIMAL IS
    emp_salary DECIMAL(10, 2);
  BEGIN
    SELECT salary INTO emp_salary FROM employees WHERE employee_id = emp_id;
    RETURN emp_salary;
  END;
  ```

#### **4. Database Triggers**
- **A trigger is a stored program that is executed automatically in response to certain events on a particular table or view.**
  ```sql
  CREATE TRIGGER trg_after_insert AFTER INSERT ON employees
  FOR EACH ROW
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO audit_log (log_message) VALUES ('New employee added: ' || :new.name);
  END;
  ```
